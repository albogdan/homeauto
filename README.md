# Description:
An idea that I thought up when I forgot to turn off the lights in my room. Relies on a communicating microcontroller system based on Arduinos and the ESP8266 WiFi chip actioning relay switches to control the lights and electronics within a house. Still a work in progress as none of the hardware has been received yet.
